## What is Emitox
***Emitox*** is a high performance, modern, lightweight, and typesafe single event instance emitter. The bigger brother of Emitox is Emitix which provides support for multiple events in a single instance. Emitox is highly optimized and performs about the same as Emitix.

## How to use Emitox

### Basic usage

```typescript
import Event, {EventListener} from "emitox";

const buttonClickEvent = new Event<[string]>();

//Adds an on-listener that gets invoked every time when the event fires.
buttonClickEvent.on((buttonId => {
    console.log(`Button: ${buttonId} has been clicked.`);
}));

//Adds a once-listener that gets invoked when the event fires and will be removed.
buttonClickEvent.once(buttonId => {})

//Without a callback/listener, the once method returns a promise.
//An optional timeout can be provided.
buttonClickEvent.once(5000).then(([buttonId]) => {
    console.log(`Button has been clicked in time.`);
}).catch(() => {
    console.log("Timeout occurred...");
})

//Removes all on/once listeners.
buttonClickEvent.off();

//EventListener utility type can be used to
//create a typesafe listener function as a variable.
const clickListener: EventListener<typeof buttonClickEvent> = (buttonId) => {};
buttonClickEvent.on(clickListener)

//Removes the specific listener.
buttonClickEvent.off(clickListener);

//Triggers the event.
//It will call every listener of the event with the provided arguments.
buttonClickEvent.emit("Btn_Top");
buttonClickEvent.emit("Btn_Bottom");

//Returns the count of listeners.
buttonClickEvent.listenerCount();
```

### Protected event
Provide the event as a getter but avoid the ability to trigger the event from outside.

```typescript
import Event, {ProtectedEvent} from "emitox";

type ButtonClickEvent = Event<[string]>;

class UiController {

    private _buttonClickEvent: ButtonClickEvent = new Event();
    get buttonClickEvent(): ProtectedEvent<ButtonClickEvent> { 
        return this.buttonClickEvent; 
    }

    private foo() {
        //Everything is okay
        this._buttonClickEvent.emit('Btn_Left');
    }
}

const uiController = new UiController();

//ERROR
uiController.buttonClickEvent.emit("Hello from outside!");

//Everything is okay
uiController.buttonClickEvent.on(buttonId => {})
```
